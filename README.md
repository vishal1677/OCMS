# OCMS - Online Class Monitoring System ( Idea Demonstration )

An Android project that demonstrates a proctoring system - a system which tracks student behavior through their mobile device, during an online class or examination. The aim of the project is to demonstrate a high-level implementation of the idea using Android APIs, that can be translated into other technologies in the future.

The system consists of two apps, the [OCMS_Client](https://github.com/shubham0204/OCMS/tree/master) app that will be used from the students' side and the [OCMS_Dashboard](https://github.com/shubham0204/OCMS/tree/dashboard) app wherein the educator can view the status of all students.
